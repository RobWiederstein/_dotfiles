# 🌟 RKW Gold Standard CLI & Dotfiles

This repository contains the standardized, modern command-line interface (CLI) and configuration for my Ubuntu/Debian virtual machines (Analytics, Immich, etc.).

It features the "Rust Rewrite" tools (eza, bat, ripgrep) and an automated setup script for fast, reproducible deployment.

---

## 🚀 One-Command Setup (New VMs)

To set up a new Ubuntu/Debian VM with the exact same CLI tools, aliases, and configuration (including Neovim, Starship, and the Welcome Message):

### Prerequisites
1.  **SSH Access:** Ensure you can SSH into the new VM as the `rkw` user.
2.  **Git Installed:** `sudo apt install git` (If not already present).

### Installation
Execute these two commands from the new VM's home directory (`~`):

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/RobWiederstein/_dotfiles.git](https://github.com/RobWiederstein/_dotfiles.git) ~/_dotfiles

# 2. Run the automated setup script (Installs tools, configures ~/.bashrc, sets up MOTD)
~/_dotfiles/setup.sh
```
After the script completes, run source ~/.bashrc or log out and log back in.

## 🔍 Tooling Overview: The Gold Standard Stack

The `setup.sh` script automatically installs the following essential tools. They are chosen to replace older, slower Unix utilities for maximum efficiency.

| Tool | Original Replacement | Why It's Important | Example Command |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **eza** | `ls` (list files) | Fast, colorful file listing with built-in Git status and file icons. | `l -l --git` |
| **bat** | `cat` (view files) | **Syntax highlighting** and line numbers for configuration files, integrates with Git. | `cat ~/.bashrc` |
| **ripgrep (\`rg\`)** | `grep` (search text) | Exponentially faster than `grep`, automatically respects `.gitignore` rules. | `rg "alias" .` |
| **fd** | `find` (find files) | Simple, intuitive syntax and significantly faster file searching. | `fd "sh$" ~` |
| **zoxide** | `cd` (change directory) | **Smart navigation** that learns your usage patterns for instant folder jumping. | `z dot` (jumps to `_dotfiles`) |
| **starship** | Shell Prompt | Fast, zero-config prompt that displays **Git branch, environment, and status codes**. | *(Shows status in the console line)* |
| **nvim** | `vi`/`vim` | A powerful, extensible modern terminal code editor. | `nvim setup.sh` |
| **trash-cli** | `rm` (delete files) | **Critical safety alias.** Moves files/directories to the system trash instead of permanent deletion. | `rm my_file.txt` (or `rm my_folder`) |

## ⚙️ Configuration Details

This section outlines where the configurations for the installed tools are located and how they are applied.

### Neovim Configuration (nvim)

* **Configuration Location:** The standard Neovim configuration file is installed at `~/.config/nvim/init.lua` (or `init.vim`).
* **How it's Added:** The `setup.sh` script **symlinks** the configuration file from this repository (e.g., `~/_dotfiles/nvim/init.lua`) to the required location (`~/.config/nvim/`).
* **Purpose:** Ensures a consistent editing experience across all VMs, including plugins, line numbering, and syntax settings.

### Alias Configuration

* **Alias Directory:** All custom aliases (like `dps`, `dcl`, `l`, `lt`) are stored in the modular directory: `~/_dotfiles/aliases.d/`.
* **The Primary Loader (`.bashrc`):** The `setup.sh` script adds a block to `~/.bashrc` that automatically sources every file in `~/_dotfiles/aliases.d/` when a new session starts. This is also where **Starship** is initialized to display your prompt.
* **Safety Aliases:** The alias file `40-safeguards.sh` implements the critical safety feature: `alias rm='trash'`. This ensures that running the single-command `rm` never results in permanent deletion, eliminating the need for the dangerous `rm -rf` command.

### Welcome Message (MOTD)

* **File Location:** The welcome screen is generated by a script placed in `/etc/update-motd.d/`.
* **Purpose:** Provides a critical summary of the machine's purpose and your key aliases every time you log in via SSH.
